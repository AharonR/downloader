# Epic 9 Retrospective: Post-Launch Maintenance & Planning

Date: 2026-02-26
Epic: 9
Status: Complete

## Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Winston (Architect)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Murat (Test Architect)
- fierce (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

- Stories completed: 2/2 (100%)
- Story types: documentation-only (9-1) + research/decision (9-2)
- No source code changes across either story
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt incurred: 0 net new items
- Test coverage: 566 tests passing, ~89.55% line coverage (unchanged)
- Production incidents: 0

Delivered scope:
- Architecture document brought in sync with as-built codebase (9-1)
- UI scope decision ratified: Tauri 2.x → proceed to Epic 10 (9-2)

## Quality and Review Outcomes

- Both stories executed with zero regressions and zero source-code changes
- Party-mode audits: 9-1 (1H/5M/3L), 9-2 (2H/4M/3L) — all findings resolved before implementation
- Pre-edit ADR snapshot + post-edit correctness gate (`find src -name "*.rs" | sort` diff, `git diff --name-only`) confirmed no accidental changes to architecture.md
- fierce ratified ui-scope-decision.md same day (2026-02-25); no decision delay
- `cargo test --lib` → 566 passed, 0 failed on both stories

## What Went Well

1. Process scaled down efficiently to documentation/decision scope — no ceremony overhead
2. Pre-edit ADR snapshot (Task 0 in 9-1) prevented any risk of accidental decision-record edits in the 1,500-line architecture.md
3. Parallel research tracks in 9-2 (Tasks 2 and 3 independent) avoided anchoring bias from the Tauri evaluation
4. Hard gate + weighted scoring framework in 9-2 produced a clear, unambiguous outcome with documented rationale
5. fierce confirmed readiness and process efficiency: "the process worked well for a documentation/decision epic — it was very efficient"
6. Post-edit correctness gates (`find src` diff, `git diff --name-only`) are strong practice regardless of story type

## Challenges and Growth Areas

1. Five of six Epic 8 action items were not addressed during Epic 9 — intentionally, as Epic 9 was scoped to maintenance/documentation and was not the right vehicle. Items now properly logged to `_bmad-output/future-issues.md` and deferred to post-Epic 10/11.

## Key Insights

1. Explicit scope constraints ("no src/ changes") keep documentation/decision stories focused and prevent scope creep
2. Pre/post validation gates are as important in documentation work as in code work — the correctness gate in 9-1 is the model to follow
3. An efficient retrospective on a narrow epic is a feature, not a failure — clean delivery on actual scope is the goal
4. A living `future-issues.md` is better than silent carry-forward between retros

## Follow-Through from Epic 8 Retrospective

| # | Action Item | Status | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | README mixed-stdin + positional examples | ❌ Not addressed | Logged to future-issues.md |
| 2 | History-search scaling policy | ❌ Not addressed | Logged to future-issues.md |
| 3 | Parse-confidence storage contract | ❌ Not addressed | Logged to future-issues.md |
| 4 | Replace unix-* session headers | ❌ Not addressed | Logged to future-issues.md |
| 5 | Non-sandbox validation path | ❌ Not addressed | Logged to future-issues.md; flag for Epic 10 CI setup |
| 6 | Story-closure checklist gate | ✅ Partially — both stories practiced thorough closure | No formal gate artifact yet |

Decision: Items 1–5 deferred to post-Epic 10/11 per fierce direction.

## Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

- Epic 10: Tauri Desktop App (3 stories outlined in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ui-scope-decision.md`)
- Preparation dependencies satisfied:
  - Architecture amendment (9-1) → accurate module map for workspace extraction ✅
  - UI scope decision (9-2) → Tauri selected and ratified ✅

## Action Items

1. `future-issues.md` created as living deferred backlog
   Owner: fierce
   Status: ✅ Done (created this session at `_bmad-output/future-issues.md`)

2. Review `future-issues.md` item 5 (non-sandbox validation path) when setting up Tauri CI pipeline
   Owner: Dana, Winston
   Timing: During Epic 10 story 10-1 (CI scaffolding)

## Epic 10 Preparation Tasks

**Critical (before epic starts):**
- [ ] Obtain Apple Developer account (~$99/yr) — Owner: fierce
- [ ] Confirm `DOWNLOADER_REQUIRE_SOCKET_TESTS=1` as standard in dev workflow and new CI pipeline — Owner: Charlie, Dana

**Early story 10-1 (parallel with epic start):**
- [ ] Choose frontend framework (Svelte / Vue 3 / React) — Owner: fierce + Charlie — decision at story 10-1 kickoff
- [ ] Document macOS E2E manual smoke checklist — Owner: Murat — must complete before story 10-2

## Critical Path

1. Frontend framework decision — must be made at story 10-1 kickoff; all subsequent stories depend on it
2. Apple Developer account — required before macOS distribution (not a blocker for development start)

## Significant Discoveries

No findings from Epic 9 invalidate the Epic 10 plan. The Tauri decision was made with full evaluation and ratified. Epic 10 plan is sound.

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: ✅ Strong — 566 tests, 89.55% coverage, clippy clean, cargo audit clean
- Deployment: ✅ CLI tool, local — no deployment concerns
- Stakeholder Acceptance: ✅ fierce ratified ui-scope-decision.md same day
- Technical Health: ✅ Strong — architecture clean, lib/bin split validated across 8 epics
- Unresolved Blockers: None blocking Epic 9 closure; Epic 10 pre-conditions documented above

## Commitments and Next Steps

1. Mark epic-9-retrospective as done in sprint-status.yaml
2. Begin Epic 10 story creation when preparation tasks are underway
   - Start with `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story` for story 10-1
   - Ensure frontend framework decision is made at 10-1 kickoff
   - Ensure `DOWNLOADER_REQUIRE_SOCKET_TESTS=1` is confirmed in new CI
3. Review `future-issues.md` at the start of the Epic 10 retrospective
