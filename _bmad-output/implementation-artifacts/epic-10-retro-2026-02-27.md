# Epic 10 Retrospective: Tauri Desktop App

Date: 2026-02-27
Epic: 10
Status: Complete

## Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Winston (Architect)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Murat (Test Architect)
- fierce (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

- Stories completed: 3/3 (100%)
- Epic focus: CLI-to-workspace migration + first native desktop app flow
- Blockers encountered: 0 blocking blockers at epic close
- Technical debt incurred: low, mostly test and CI hardening follow-ups
- Quality signals: workspace build/test/clippy gates pass; frontend unit tests pass; manual Tauri smoke checks documented
- Production incidents: 0

Delivered scope:
- Story 10-1: Cargo workspace extraction completed (`downloader-core`, `downloader-cli`), CI updated for workspace commands
- Story 10-2: Tauri app scaffolded (Svelte + TypeScript), basic input + download trigger UX shipped
- Story 10-3: Progress events, in-flight progress UI, cancellation, and completion summary shipped

## Quality and Review Outcomes

- No acceptance criteria left open across 10-1, 10-2, 10-3
- Validation coverage expanded from CLI-only to workspace + app surfaces
- Review follow-ups in stories were closed (including race-condition and final progress-event fixes in 10-3)
- Manual GUI validation path is documented and repeatable; CI remains headless-safe for workspace checks

## What Went Well

1. Structural refactor stayed disciplined: core logic moved into `downloader-core` without functional regression in existing CLI flows.
2. The story sequence was correct: foundation first (10-1), trigger UX second (10-2), progress/cancel polish third (10-3).
3. Cross-layer consistency was preserved: What/Why/Fix error pattern was carried from CLI into GUI.
4. Team handled review feedback quickly; high-severity issues were resolved inside the same epic.
5. Svelte + Tauri implementation reached usable end-to-end behavior without introducing backend architecture churn.

## Challenges and Growth Areas

1. GUI validation remains partly manual (expected for current platform constraints), so confidence still depends on disciplined smoke execution.
2. Story artifacts show recurring risk around concurrency/state (cancel + progress races); this was fixed in 10-3 but should remain a watch area.
3. CI quality gates were updated for workspace layout, but non-sandbox network validation is still a strategic gap carried in future issues.

## Key Insights

1. Extracting stable domain logic into `downloader-core` materially reduced UI integration risk.
2. Polling-based progress works well enough for the current app and aligns with existing queue/engine architecture.
3. Event-driven UI needs explicit “final state emission” and race-safe cancellation semantics to avoid stale UX.
4. Story-level AI audit loops were effective in finding architectural edge cases before they escaped the epic.

## Follow-Through from Epic 9 Retrospective

| # | Epic 9 Carry-Forward Item | Status in Epic 10 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Keep `future-issues.md` as living backlog | ✅ Completed | File exists and remains active |
| 2 | Review non-sandbox validation path during Epic 10 CI setup | ⏳ In Progress | CI/workspace updates were made, but full non-sandbox validation path is still deferred in `future-issues.md` item 5 |

Continuity takeaway: Epic 10 executed its direct delivery goals well; one strategic quality-gate item remains intentionally deferred.

## Next Epic Preview and Dependencies

- Epic 11 document was not found in planning artifacts.
- Outcome: no fixed next-epic dependency chain can be validated yet.
- Recommendation: run a focused planning pass before kickoff so Epic 11 scope reflects what Epic 10 actually delivered.

## Action Items

1. Formalize non-sandbox integration validation path and promote it to a standard quality gate.
   Owner: Dana, Winston
   Deadline: before Epic 11 implementation story enters review
   Success criteria: documented command path + repeatable pass/fail evidence in CI workflow docs

2. Add a GUI regression smoke checklist as a first-class artifact (not only completion notes).
   Owner: Murat
   Deadline: before Epic 11 story 1 completion
   Success criteria: checklist file exists, includes progress/cancel/error-path verification, referenced by story DoD

3. Add explicit concurrent-run policy tests for app commands (`start_download_with_progress` + `cancel_download`).
   Owner: Charlie
   Deadline: before Epic 11 story 2 review
   Success criteria: tests guard against overlapping runs and stale cancel state

4. Publish app/CLI configuration alignment note (defaults, config path behavior, fallback rules).
   Owner: Winston
   Deadline: before Epic 11 planning sign-off
   Success criteria: architecture/planning artifact updated with configuration contract

5. Keep What/Why/Fix message templates centralized to avoid drift between CLI and GUI.
   Owner: Alice, Charlie
   Deadline: before Epic 11 feature implementation starts
   Success criteria: one shared guidance source referenced by both UI and CLI error surfaces

## Preparation Tasks (For Epic 11 Planning)

- [ ] Define Epic 11 objective and story map from current roadmap state
- [ ] Confirm GUI test strategy boundaries (unit/integration/manual/E2E) per platform
- [ ] Prioritize deferred `future-issues.md` items against Epic 11 scope
- [ ] Decide whether first Epic 11 stories are GUI-deepening or cross-cutting platform hardening
- [ ] Reconfirm release-readiness criteria for desktop app milestones

## Critical Path Items

1. Epic 11 planning artifact creation and ratification
   Owner: fierce, Alice
   Gate: must exist before new story creation

2. Non-sandbox validation decision (implement now vs. explicit defer with rationale)
   Owner: Dana, Winston
   Gate: must be resolved before Epic 11 quality gate definition is finalized

3. Desktop app readiness baseline (smoke protocol + ownership)
   Owner: Murat
   Gate: must be defined before Epic 11 story reviews begin

## Significant Discoveries

No discovery from Epic 10 invalidates previously documented architecture direction. The workspace split + Tauri app path remains the right direction.

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: ✅ Strong for current scope (workspace gates and app unit tests are in place)
- Deployment/Release Readiness: ⚠️ Partial (manual desktop smoke path exists; release criteria still need formalization for next phase)
- Stakeholder Acceptance: ✅ Epic stories are completed and acceptance criteria closed
- Technical Health: ✅ Stable after race-condition fixes in progress/cancel flow
- Unresolved Blockers: None blocking Epic 10 closure

## Commitments and Next Steps

1. Mark `epic-10-retrospective` as done in `sprint-status.yaml`.
2. Start Epic 11 planning before any new implementation story starts.
3. Carry forward quality-gate hardening items from this retro and `future-issues.md`.
4. Re-check readiness gates at first Epic 11 story review.

## Team Performance Summary

Epic 10 achieved full delivery of planned stories and established a working desktop GUI baseline without regressing existing CLI behavior. The team demonstrated strong adaptation during architectural transition work and closed key review risks within the epic.
