# Epic 3 Retrospective: Reliable Batch Processing

Date: 2026-02-17
Epic: 3
Status: Complete

## Summary

- Stories completed: 6/6 (100%)
- Epic status in sprint tracking: `done`
- Epic retrospective status at session start: `optional`
- Scope delivered:
  - Input parsing feedback and confidence signaling
  - Progress spinner and in-place status output
  - Completion summary with grouped failure guidance
  - Graceful interrupt handling with persistent queue recovery
  - Resumable downloads with queue-backed progress metadata

## What Worked

1. Reliability features were delivered in the right order: visibility first, recovery second.
2. Queue persistence and resume logic materially improved trust in long-running batches.
3. Review-driven follow-ups improved edge-case coverage before story closure.

## Lessons Learned (Brief)

1. Batch reliability depends on both UX clarity and recovery mechanics; either one alone is insufficient.
2. Interrupt/resume behavior must be integration-tested with real queue state transitions.
3. Failure summaries should always include actionable next steps, not just error counts.
4. Terminal capabilities must gate dynamic rendering to avoid degraded output in non-interactive contexts.

## Follow-Through from Epic 2

- Applied:
  - End-to-end runtime path checks and stronger parser/CLI integration discipline carried into Story 3.1.
  - Story close-out rigor (tests + review follow-ups) was consistently maintained.

## Next Epic Preview: Epic 4 (Authenticated Downloads)

- Readiness signal: Epic 3 created a stable execution and recovery base for auth-sensitive workflows.
- Key dependency proven: persistent queue + resumability reduces risk when auth retries or interruptions occur.

## Action Items

1. Keep interruption/resume tests mandatory for any queue or download-engine behavior changes.

2. Keep completion summary taxonomy consistent as new failure classes are introduced.
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev), Winston (Architect)
3. Preserve terminal-compatibility guardrails whenever progress UI output is modified.
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)

## Readiness and Close

- Significant discovery requiring Epic 4 scope change: No.
- Unresolved blockers: None for Epic 4 startup.
- Retrospective outcome: Healthy with concrete process carry-forward.
