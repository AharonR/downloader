# Epic 5 Retrospective: Organized Output

Date: 2026-02-17
Epic: 5
Status: Complete

## Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Winston (Architect)
- fierce (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

- Stories completed: 4/4 (100%)
- Epic status in sprint tracking: `done`
- Epic retrospective status at session start: `optional`
- Scope delivered:
  - Project folder creation with sanitization and safety guards
  - Nested sub-project path support
  - Metadata-based file naming with deterministic fallbacks
  - Project index generation with append behavior

## What Went Well

1. Story sequencing was effective: path safety first, then metadata naming, then indexing.
2. Audit and code-review follow-ups were applied in-story instead of deferred.
3. Test coverage grew with each story and stayed aligned with acceptance criteria.

## Lessons Learned

1. Cross-platform path safety must be treated as a first-class requirement, not a polish task.
2. Queue-level metadata persistence simplifies downstream features (naming and indexing).
3. Append-only project artifacts are safer when session-delta logic is explicit and tested.

## Follow-Through from Epic 4

- Applied:
  - Metadata contract and sanitization/idempotency preparation carried directly into Epic 5 implementation.
  - Cross-epic quality discipline improved via audit + review follow-ups in each story.
- Not in Epic 5 scope:
  - Remaining auth-specific debt from Epic 4 (403 differentiation and resolver auth summary unification).

## Next Epic Preview: Epic 6 (Download History)

- Planned focus:
  - Download attempt logging
  - Failure categorization and troubleshooting data
  - Per-project history log output
  - `downloader log` query command
- Dependency note:
  - Epic 5 metadata and saved-path fields provide a strong foundation for history records.

## Action Items

1. Keep the quality gate: no story closes without audit follow-up resolution or explicit carry-forward owner.
   - Owner: Bob (Scrum Master), Dana (QA Engineer)
2. Improve project index readability by switching session headings from raw unix labels to a human-readable timestamp format.
   - Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
3. Add one CLI e2e assertion that validates real `index.md` generation behavior on project runs.
   - Owner: Dana (QA Engineer), Charlie (Senior Dev)
4. Prepare Epic 6 data model updates with explicit query fields (status, project, date range, source domain).
   - Owner: Winston (Architect), Charlie (Senior Dev)

## Significant Discovery Review

- No fundamental discovery from Epic 5 requires redefining Epic 6 scope.
- Epic update required: No.

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing and quality: Strong for delivered Epic 5 scope.
- Stakeholder value: High; organization outcomes are user-visible and practical.
- Technical health: Stable; no blocking issues identified for Epic 6 kickoff.
- Unresolved blockers: None for starting Epic 6 planning and story creation.

## Commitments and Next Steps

1. Track Epic 5 action items in normal engineering workflow.
2. Start Epic 6 with Story 6.1 and keep the same audit/review rigor.
3. Re-check carry-over debt from Epic 4 and Epic 5 during the next retrospective.
